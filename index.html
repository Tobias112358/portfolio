                    <li class="work"><h3 class="work-title">Software Deployment</h3><p class="work-description">One of my roles at Unicard was to design and deploy solutions for various clients. I migrated some applications to a serverless architecture, and worked on procedures for deploying software for new customers. <br />My work enhanced the speed of our solution deployments, making them ready for UAT more efficiently.</p></li>
                    <li class="work" id="simple-synth"><h3 class="work-title">AWS Solution Architecture</h3><p class="work-description">I was responsible for developing scalable and secure solutions on AWS. A project I worked on involved designing and implementing the VPC for our in-house solutions, which allowed Unicard to sell to smaller clients who couldn't host our solutions on their own infrastructure. This design was SOC2 compliant and followed the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html">AWS Well-Architected Framework</a>.</p></li>
                    <li class="work"><h3 class="work-title">ASP.NET Development</h3><p class="work-description">I worked on feature additions and bug fixes of our codebase, which was mostly in ASP.NET. Some features include allowing higher quality photos to be uploaded, and a typeahead search feature within the CaptureME software.</p></li>
                    <li class="work"><h3 class="work-title">SOC2 Compliance</h3><p class="work-description">I was part of the security team tasked with implementing SOC2 procedures. I was in charge of implementing these procedures on our cloud infrastructure. This includes:<br />Automated backups, patches and metric notifications. S3 bucket policies and Security Group whitelists for EC2 instances. IAM permissions following the principle of least privilege.Designing sufficient CloudWatch logging and alarms.</p></li>
